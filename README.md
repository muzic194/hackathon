Why R? 2019 hackathon project 
================

This repository contains our solution during WhyR hackaton 2019.

We created application which allows to navigate on the Warsaw map and observe localisation oh the healthcare services with relation to demography of specific place.


Data provided by hackaton organizers contains various places located in Warsaw, such as restaurants, shops, markets and other services. From the data we selected only locations with healtcare services (dentist, doctor, hospital, pharmacy), which is 12% of the total data.

We performed analysis and visualisation to exclude unimportant columns and data with missing values.




Our tool is available on the link:
